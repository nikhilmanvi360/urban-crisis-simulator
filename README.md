# CitySentinel AI : Urban Crisis Intelligence
### *Predictive Urban Environmental Crisis Simulator (PUECS)*

**CitySentinel AI** is a state-of-the-art urban crisis management platform designed for the modern smart city. Built for the **Ballary Hackathon (Challenge 6)**, it uses predictive modeling and cascading risk analysis to forecast environmental emergencies — from AQI spikes to water stress — and provides actionable policy recommendations for city administrators.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Cascading Risk Analysis**: Models dependencies between urban systems (Infrastructure → Ecology → Health) to predict how a localized failure (like a traffic surge) amplifies into a city-wide AQI crisis.
- **Monte Carlo Policy Simulations**: Stress-test urban resilience by simulating up to 5 concurrent policy scenarios side-by-side.
- **Decision Support System**: Ranked policy interventions based on "Efficiency Score" (Risk Reduction vs. Implementation Cost).
- **Zonal Risk Heatmap**: A high-fidelity temporal visualization of how environmental risks propagate across 5 key urban zones over a 30-day window.
- **ML-Powered Forecaster**: Integrates with a Python microservice using Prophet and XGBoost to provide confidence-weighted crisis probabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is structured as a robust 3-tier microservice architecture:

| Component | Technology | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, Recharts | Interactive Dashboards & Simulations |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, MongoDB | Risk Engines, API Orchestration, Data Persistence |
| **ML Service** | Python (FastAPI), Prophet, XGBoost | Time-series Forecasting & Risk Quantification |
